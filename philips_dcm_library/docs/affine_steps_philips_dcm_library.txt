rotation matrix:
ndarray: 
[[ 0. -0. -1.  0.]
 [ 1.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0. -1.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  1.]]
 
 resmat
 ndarray: 
 [[ 0.977  0.     0.     0.   ]
 [ 0.     0.977  0.     0.   ]
 [ 0.     0.     5.     0.   ]
 [ 0.     0.     0.     1.   ]]

 np.dot(rotmat, resmat)
 [[ 0.    -0.    -5.     0.   ]
 [ 0.977  0.     0.     0.   ]
 [ 0.    -0.977  0.001  0.   ]
 [ 0.     0.     0.     1.   ]]
 Before any axis reformantting:
 ndarray: 
[[   0.      -0.      -5.      39.253]
 [   0.977    0.       0.    -139.565]
 [   0.      -0.977    0.001  133.356]
 [   0.       0.       0.       1.   ]]
Patient to Tailarach matrix:
ndarray: 
[[  -1.    0.    0.  255.]
 [   0.   -1.    0.  255.]
 [   0.    0.    1.    0.]
 [   0.    0.    0.    1.]] 
 Changed the order of product in code and it now seems to work.
